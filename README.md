# HandsFree

In this project created with P5js you will be able to interact with your laptop's camera, in order to create generative art with your fingers when performing different actions.

## Instructions:

### Left hand:
#### 1 finger
Deep color change from gray to black
#### 2 finger
Add circles
#### 3 finger
Draw circles
#### 4 finger
Background color change from black to gray

### Right hand:
#### First state finger 2:
In this mode on the right you can see how circle 1 is painted randomly and circle 2 has a random stroke.
If the circles go to the left, only the stroke can be seen. White for circle 1 and random for circle 2.
Apart from that they are getting smaller and smaller.
Apart from that, the randomly painted rectangle comes out and gets smaller and smaller

#### Second state finger 3:
This mode is similar to the previous one but with the variant that the rectangles are not painted inside and only the random color line is seen.
Other than that, circle 2 and rectangle resize faster.
On the part of circle 1 the resizing is slower than circle 2.
On the right is circle 1 with a white stroke and on the right is a randomly painted circle.

#### Third state finger 4:
In this mode only the rectangles are unpainted inside. Growing up small and big.
